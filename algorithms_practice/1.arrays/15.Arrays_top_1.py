"""
This algorithm receives an array and returns most_frequent_value
Also, sometimes it is possible to have multiple 'most_frequent_value's,
so this function returns a list. This result can be used to find a
representative value in an array.
This algorithm gets an array, makes a dictionary of it,
 finds the most frequent count, and makes the result list.
For example: top_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]) will return [1, 2]
(TL:DR) Get mathematical Mode
Complexity: O(n)
